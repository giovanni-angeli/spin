spin
====


spin is a simple implementation of an rpc framework based on python3, asyncIO
and aiozmq (http://aiozmq.readthedocs.org).

spin can be used programmatically to develop a distributed system of
applications communicating with each other, but also from inside ipython3
to test/debug/verify etc. interactively.
